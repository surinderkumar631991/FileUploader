Issue happens when:
Confirming a subsite with no areas. (subsites does not show  but everything works when logging out and back in.)
Confirming a subsite with an area. (subsites does not show  but everything works when logging out and back in.)
It looks like it somehow just needs to be refreshed and it works because logging out and back in works as expected.
Watch both videos

Acceptance criteria/expectation:
It should show the subsite confirmed. Logging out and back in step should not be needed.
